## Course Overview

The goal is to introduce programming for the web. This is a broad concept, so
specifically we will look at how to make a web app using only the client side
browser (i.e chrome on a personal laptop). The technologies we will use to do
this:

html: http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp &
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML

css: http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp &
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference

bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/

javascript: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript &
  http://eloquentjavascript.net/ &
  http://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/

angular: https://angularjs.org/

Roughly speaking, html, css, and bootstrap are visual components that an end
user actually sees, whereas javascript and angular are logical components that
allow devs to make a website dynamic by changing the visual components based on
user interaction.

This course is also an introduction to programming in general with the above as
our vehicle. A few things that may be useful for those of you that have little
or no experience with programming:

  - Get comfortable with not knowing certain things (nobody is expected to know
    every html tag, for instance, devs often look them up).
     - Also, during this course I will always admit when I don't know something,
       expect that to happen a lot!
  - Get comfortable looking things up (how to word things in a google search,
    using stack overflow, reading documentation, etc.).
  - Despite the above, don't be afraid to ask! Sometimes you may be looking for
    something on google you aren't even sure how to phrase.
